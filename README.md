## Project Goals
With this project, I set out to sharpen my Microsoft Excel skills and learn how to code in VBA, which was new to me. I worked with stock data to acheive these goals.

## Tools and Solutions
I made extensive use of VBA's <a href="https://www.excel-easy.com/vba/loop.html">"For" loops</a> and its <a href="https://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/if_then.php">"If/Then/Else/Else If" conditionals</a> to iterate over the dataset. I utilized the languages's <a href="https://www.automateexcel.com/vba/cell-value-get-set/">"Cells().Value" command</a> to create summary tables displaying the finished data. I also learned the basics of setting VBA variables to integers and other values.

## Outcomes and Lessons Learned
I emerged from VBA-challenge with a solid understanding of iteration, conditionals, and variable declaration. You can see my finished project code <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/VBA-challenge/blob/master/StockTool.vbs">here</a> and some screenshots of my final tables <a href="https://github.com/sonder74/VBA-challenge/tree/master/Screenshots">here</a>.
